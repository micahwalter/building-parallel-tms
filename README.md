### Parallel-TMS

[Aaron](http://www.aaronland.info) and I did a thing at this year's [Museum Computer Network](http://mcn.edu) conference in Seattle. his slides are on his [website now](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2012/11/09/jello/#parallel-tms). I am insanely exhausted and looking forward to #drinkingaboutmuseums sometime soon in NYC! 

Enjoy!
